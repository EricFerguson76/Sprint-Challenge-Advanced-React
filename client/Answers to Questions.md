Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element. It also uses lifecycle hooks.


Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Mounting phase:  Whatever initial data you want access to will be defined on the constructor of this phase.
Updating phase:  Updates component data.
Un-mounting phase:  Component is removed from the screen.

What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Custom hooks are functions that let you reuse stateful behavior between different components.

Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing minimizes the risk of bugs finding their way into your code.
